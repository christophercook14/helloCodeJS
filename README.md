# HelloCodeJS

### What is it?

Ever gotten frustrated with trying to figure out what a function did in an unfamiliar github repository? HelloCodeJS was built to solve that problem. It statically analyzes all of the function calls and declarations in a repo and visualizes them as a graph.
Written by Chris Cook, Sergio "Gio" Gomez, Kevin Hurley, and Yi Chao from Fullstack Academy Chicago.
